        <p>Hello, world! Nice to meet you all :D My name is Kek Meng Siong
            and I am currently broadening my knowledge in computer science eventhough
            I have no prior experience in this. It's been a crazy journey thus far
            but all I can say is that my interest in this field has just been growing! Hopefully someday
            this knowledge I have gained will prove helpful and even if not I am glad I took the course
            eitherways!
        </p>

            <h1 class="center">Education</h1>
            <p>
                I am a recent graduate in Aircraft Maintenance & Airworthiness Engineering from University of
                Limierck, Ireland. I also studied Cambridge A-Levels before pursuing my degree as stated above.

            <h1 class="center">Games</h1>
            <p>
                During my free time, I enjoy playing video games to release my stress from studying. Although at 
                certain times, playing video games can be a double-egded sword as it can also induce
                more stress when the difficulty is too high. If you would like to know know more about the games
                I have played or am playing, click <a class="linkcolor" href="games.html"><em><u>here!</u></em></a>

            <h1 class="center">Music</h1>
            <p>
                Another hoby I have is listening to music and I listen to all kinds of genres. Most people
                are unable to concentrate with music on however I am on the other end of this as it is near impossible
                for me to do so as it would be too quiet and boring. I'm weird like that. If you would like to know
                more about some of my favourite songs and artist, click <a class="linkcolor" href="music.html"><em><u>here!</u></em></a>

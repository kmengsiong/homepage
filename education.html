                My major is in Aircraft Maintenance And Airworthiness Engineering. I graduated with a <em>First Class Honours</em> in the year 2019. The course includes
                modules that are needed to get an <strong>EASA</strong>(European Union Aviation Safety Agency) license. These modules were very difficult as it requires
                a minimum score of <em>75</em> just for a PASS. Thus, the course was very intensive in that sense. Other modules I studied include mechanics of solid, CAD,
                MATLAB and etc.

                    I studied Cambridge A-Levels during my pre-university years and took <em>Psychology, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry</em> as my subjects.
                    I had a great time and made plenty of friends and also became a committee member for the Student Council and was given the opportunity to
                    plan events together with my fellow members.
